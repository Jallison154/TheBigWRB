   - Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
   - The MAC address will be displayed in the correct format for copying to your code

Alternatively, you can use this simple sketch:
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.printf("MAC Address: %s\n", WiFi.macAddress().c_str());
}
void loop() {}
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Receiver
In `Receiver ESP32`, update the allowed transmitter MACs:
```cpp
uint8_t ALLOWED_TX_MACS[][6] = {
  { 0x58,0x8C,0x81,0x9F,0x22,0xAC }, // Your transmitter MAC
  // Add more transmitters as needed
};
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Transmitter
In `Transmitter_ESP32.ino`, update the receiver MAC:
```cpp
uint8_t RX_MAC[] = { 0x58,0x8C,0x81,0x9E,0x30,0x10 }; // Your receiver MAC
```

### Pin Configuration
- `LED_PIN`: D10 (status LED)
- `BTN1_PIN`: D1 (button 1)

   scp button1.wav pi@WRB01.local:~/WRB/sounds/
   scp button2.wav pi@WRB01.local:~/WRB/sounds/
   scp hold1.wav pi@WRB01.local:~/WRB/sounds/
   scp hold2.wav pi@WRB01.local:~/WRB/sounds/
   ```

##### **Step 10: Final Verification**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status WRB-enhanced.service

# View button press logs
tail -f ~/WRB/button_log.txt

# Test button presses on your ESP32 transmitter
# You should see log entries and hear sounds
```

#### Usage:

1. **Sound Files**: Place your sound files in `~/WRB/` or on a USB drive
   - **Quick Press Sounds**: `button1*.wav`, `button2*.wav`
   - **Hold Sounds**: `hold1*.wav`, `hold2*.wav`
   - **USB Drive**: Place files in root directory of USB drive

2. **Button Mapping**:
   - **Button 1 Quick Press** → Plays `button1*.wav` sound
   - **Button 1 Hold (1s)** → Plays `hold1*.wav` sound
   - **Button 2 Quick Press** → Plays `button2*.wav` sound
   - **Button 2 Hold (1s)** → Plays `hold2*.wav` sound

3. **Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   sudo systemctl status WRB-enhanced.service
   
   # View real-time logs
   sudo journalctl -u WRB-enhanced.service -f
   
   # View button press history
   tail -f ~/WRB/button_log.txt
   ```

#### Configuration:

The script automatically detects:
- ESP32 serial connection (tries multiple ports)
- Sound files from USB drives or local storage
- LED feedback on GPIO pin 23 (ready status)
- USB drive status on GPIO pin 24

You can customize the configuration by editing the variables at the top of the Pi script:
```python
BAUD = 115200                    # Serial baud rate
SERIAL = "/dev/ttyACM0"          # Default serial port
READY_PIN = 23                   # Ready LED pin
USB_LED_PIN = 24                 # USB drive LED pin
HOLD_DELAY_MS = 1000             # Hold delay in milliseconds
LOG_FILE = "/home/pi/WRB/button_log.txt"  # Log file location
```

#### LED Indicators:

The system uses two LEDs for status indication:

1. **Ready LED (GPIO 23)**: 
   - **ON**: System ready and connected to ESP32
   - **OFF**: System starting up or disconnected
   - **Blink**: Button press or hold detected

2. **USB LED (GPIO 24)**:
   - **ON**: USB drive is mounted
   - **OFF**: No USB drive mounted
   - **Blink**: USB drive with sound files detected

#### Testing USB LED:

You can test the USB LED functionality independently using the test script:

```bash
# Run the USB LED test script
python3 test_usb_led.py
```

This script will:
- Check for mounted USB drives
- Control the USB LED based on mount status
- Test sound file detection
- Provide feedback in simulation mode if gpiozero is not available

#### Troubleshooting:

1. **No Sound**: Check audio permissions and pygame installation
2. **No Serial Connection**: Verify ESP32 is connected and check serial port
3. **Service Won't Start**: Check logs with `sudo journalctl -u WRB-enhanced.service`
4. **Permission Errors**: Ensure pi user is in the audio group
5. **USB LED Not Working**: Check GPIO pin 24 connections and run test script
6. **Hold Sounds Not Playing**: Verify hold sound files are properly named and located
7. **Wrong Sound Playing**: Check file naming convention matches expected pattern

The enhanced Pi script provides a complete, production-ready solution for integrating your ESP32 wireless button system with advanced audio feedback, including the new hold functionality, on a Raspberry Pi.
